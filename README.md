**Project Thesis**  
**Student:** [Hamed Ramezan Zadeh]
**Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. [Florian Ashauer]  
**Start Date:** November 2025

### Project Overview
Design and implementation of a lightweight hardware accelerator for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on an ASIC using IHP SG13S 130nm CMOS technology.

### Repository Structure
- `weekly-reports/` → Weekly progress reports (one Markdown file per week)
- `rtl/` → Verilog/SystemVerilog/VHDL source codes (will be added)
- `simulation/` → Testbenches and simulation scripts
- `docs/` → Papers, datasheets, and notes
- `layout/` → Cadence flow files (later stages)
